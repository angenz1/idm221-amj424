          The Amish Project, directed by John Gancar, is a fictional exploration
          of the 2006 Nickel Mines schoolhouse shooting in Lancaster
          Pennsylvania. It explores the Amish community and the path of
          forgiveness and compassion forged in its wake. The play, which was
          first produced at the New York International Fringe Festival in 2008,
          was originally performed by the author as a solo piece. The WCR will
          be producing the ensemble edition with eight well-known and talented
          local actors. The Amish Project is presented by special arrangement
          with Samuel French Inc a Concord Theatricals Company. Masks required.
