WCR Center for the Arts Website Redesign

Overview

The WCR Center for the Arts holds a special place in my heart, so I have decided to revamp the center's website. Having experienced two years of violin lessons at the center, I felt a deep connection to the vibrant community and sought to address the challenges observed in the current website.

Motivation

Despite the personal attachment to this cultural gem, the existing WCR Center for the Arts website poses challenges for users. Navigating through the maze of unnecessary clicks can be confusing and frustrating. The website's design, while functional, lacks the charm and cohesiveness deserving of such a prominent cultural hub.

Vision

The goal of this website makeover is to create a user-friendly, intuitive platform that reflects the vibrancy of the community it serves. The vision is straightforward: reorganize the homepage to prominently feature events. This strategic change aims to provide visitors with seamless access to crucial event information without the need to navigate through multiple pages.

Design Approach

The redesign focuses on minimizing reliance on excessive clicks. A key element is the introduction of a more intuitive scrolling feature, simplifying the user experience and creating a cleaner and more inviting website. The intent is not just to improve the website's aesthetics but to enhance functionality, ensuring that users can easily explore the center's offerings.

Contribution

This website redesign is not merely a technical endeavor but a passionate effort to give back to a community that plays a significant role in the community of Reading. By creating a more accessible and appealing online platform, the goal is to contribute to the WCR Center for the Arts' success and help it reach a wider audience.

The journey involves reimagining the website's structure, enhancing the user interface, and ensuring that every click serves a purpose. The ultimate aim is to create a virtual space that mirrors the vibrancy and creativity found within the walls of the WCR Center for the Arts.
